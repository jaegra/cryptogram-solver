(actually, there are a lot of negative\\nconnotations that go with that rep, including copious questions about\\nmy masculinity, party affiliation, and sexual preference.)\\n\\n>gant hadn\\'t been wasting time all\\n>game.  the game had been cruising along, and was just over two hours old.\\n\\nirrelevant.  he was wasting time then.\\n\\n>the score was 1-0, with 2 outs in the ninth and a runner in scoring position.\\n>is there *any* reason hirschbeck couldn\\'t, and shouldn\\'t, cut gant a little\\n>slack?  \\n\\n1.  because it\\'s not his job.\\n\\n2.  because setting the precedent of cutting slack there can easily \\n    extend to those 3 hour games.  (kind of like the phantom dp.)\\n\\n>for no discernible constructive reason, hirschbeck disrupted the\\n>game, caused a five minute delay, and materially hurt the batter in a key\\n>situation.  did he have a date to get to?\\n\\ngant hurt himself, and the braves disrupted the game.  your biases are\\nexposed, and i\\'m sitting here defending umpires and the sf giants,\\nwhich is like phyllis schlafly defending gary segura, jack kevorkian,\\nand the swedish abortion team.  \\n\\n>and i still wonder why terry was tossed earlier in the game.\\n\\ni believe terry said the magic word.  there are some truly quick ways\\nto get tossed from a ballgame.  for a primer, email me.\\n\\ngood ways to get tossed from a game:\\n\\n1.  ask ken kaiser if he got his money back from nutri-system.\\n2.  kiss rich garcia on the lips, and say \"hi, honey, i\\'m home!\"\\n3.  goose eric gregg.\\n4.  ask bruce froemming if his parents had any children that lived.\\n5.  get naked.\\n\\n(source: the greg spira book of diamond ettiquette, as told to\\n peter gammons.  1991, collier press.)\\n\\n\\n-- \\n*   gary huckabay   * \"outside?!  that was right down the bleedin\\' pipe, *\\n* \"balder than any  *  kenny!  i realize i don\\'t have great control, but *\\n*  dave on the net. *  c\\'mon!\"  \"gary, that was a styrofoam cup.  the    *\\n*      really.\"     *  plate\\'s a foot to your right.  throw the ball.\"   *\\n'"
